    # 1.1 TODO: Convert the string `movies_str` into a list and assign it to a variable called `remaining_50_list`

    # Print out the `type` of your new variable, then in a separate print statement, the number of items in it (should be 50).

    # 1.2 TODO: Hmm. Looks like `remaining_50_list` contains the movie "The Matrix" which is also in the "top_50_list".
    # Let's remove this duplicate title from `remaining_50_list`. 
    # Let's use our conditional logic to check if "The Matrix" is still in `remaining_50_list`
    # Print `"The Matrix" in remaining_50_list`. It should print out `False`.
    # NOTE: Make sure to double check the list you are removing from!

    # 1.3 TODO: Let's add a movie to the end of the list called "Anywhere But Here".
    # Let's use conditional logic again to check if the last movie in the list is now "Anywhere But Here".
    # Use 'indexing' and conditional logic to check.
    # NOTE: if there are 50 movies in the list, what's the index of the final movie?

    # 1.4 TODO: Let's make sure "remaining_50_list" has exactly 50 movie titles.
    # Print out the number of title-strings in the list (count it with code!)

    # 1.5 TODO: Great! Let's combine the two lists into one list called `top_100`.
    # NOTE: Which list should be first when you combine them? The top 50 titles, or the remaining 50?
    # Print out the number of title-strings in the list (count it with code!)

    # 1.6 TODO: Let's print the first movie in our `top_100`list.
    # Use 'indexing' to do this.

    # 1.7 TODO: Print the top 10 movies in `top_100` as a list.

    # 2.3 TODO: We want to join the first name and last name with a '.' and save it in a variable called
    # `joined_names` (use a string method to join the list into a new string) Print out the variable.
